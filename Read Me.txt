AuditFlow AI  
First AI-Powered Continuous Auditing Platform for Chartered Accountants  

CA's practices today are drowning in manual sampling, 40–60 hour audit cycles, talent shortages, and rising client pressure for faster delivery with lower fees. Most frauds and GST/TDS errors go undetected until the assessment stage because traditional methods check only 2–5% of transactions. AuditFlow AI changes that completely: upload any ledger/Excel/CSV and in under 10 seconds it scans 100% of transactions, flags duplicates, round-figure entries, weekend fraud, high-value anomalies, and vendor loops – with plain-English AI explanations for every red flag. From 40+ hours of grunt work to 40 seconds of actionable insight.
